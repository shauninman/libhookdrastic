- cleanup toolchain makefile

- figure out what can be reused with libhookppsspp on smart pro (non-s)

- create a battery thread that keeps the battery icon in sync and caches its rendering to a texture that can be blitted when red to non-menu screens too

- add htop and taskset to tina image
	pin hot thread to a specific core?
- start breaking common utils (constants, init, drawing, settings, utils) into header only includes
- cache more menu bits?
	to reduce memory churn
- show game screens beneath goodbye message?
- an archive, library, or backlog for games on device that shouldn't appear in the switcher
	I think "library" is the most neutral

BUGS
- in_drastic_menu doesn't work anymore

-----------------------------------------------

Look up program function (eg. Drastic's quit)

	nm ./drastic | grep quit
	0000000000089c70 T lua_quit
	000000000008a110 T platform_quit
	000000000000e8d0 T quit
	000000000007a260 T select_quit

then in Cutter find sym.quit, show Xrefs, and trace its args up through the call sites
