- revert to faux sleep? mem sleep is kinda buggy
- change crop/spread buttons to combos (MENU+)
	too many accidental presses
- if charging at boot launch a batmon?
	from main.sh
	create batmon :sweat_smile:
- pull current sd card structure
	create userdata folder, etc
- add htop and taskset to tina image
	pin hot thread to a specific core?


BUGS
- sometimes doesn't respond to input after sleep?
	but it's not hung, I can kill drastic from shell
	I wonder if the audio thread is hung/paused?
	or is it a timing thing in drastic itself?
	can't reproduce...
- sometimes audio doesn't return after sleep?
- I think audio/performance is worse after wake?

-----------------------------------------------

Look up program function (eg. Drastic's quit)

	nm ./drastic | grep quit
	0000000000089c70 T lua_quit
	000000000008a110 T platform_quit
	000000000000e8d0 T quit
	000000000007a260 T select_quit

then in Cutter find sym.quit, show Xrefs, and trace its args up through the call sites
