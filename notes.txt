- cleanup toolchain makefile

- can allow drastic menu to open without rendering or handling input to ensure clock/audio queue remains in sync?

- make device suspend after timeout in menu?
- open menu and immediately sleep on power press?
- create a battery thread that keeps the battery icon in sync and caches its rendering to a texture that can be blitted when red to non-menu screens too
- revert to faux sleep
	mem sleep is kinda buggy

- add htop and taskset to tina image
	pin hot thread to a specific core?
- start breaking common utils (constants, init, drawing, settings, utils) into header only includes
- cache more menu bits?
	to reduce memory churn
- show game screens beneath goodbye message?
- an archive, library, or backlog for games on device that shouldn't appear in the switcher
	I think "library" is the most neutral

BUGS
- in_drastic_menu doesn't work anymore
- sometimes doesn't boot into save state (can result in dataloss)
	I think this is fixed
- toggling ff rapidly hangs drastic
- sometimes audio doesn't return after sleep?
	I also think audio/performance is worse after wake?
	could this be a timing thing or just some subsystem not fully restoring?
	this is fixed by toggling fast forward !?

-----------------------------------------------

Look up program function (eg. Drastic's quit)

	nm ./drastic | grep quit
	0000000000089c70 T lua_quit
	000000000008a110 T platform_quit
	000000000000e8d0 T quit
	000000000007a260 T select_quit

then in Cutter find sym.quit, show Xrefs, and trace its args up through the call sites
