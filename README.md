## Presentation

DEDICATED OS integer scales and crops the overscan on the MagicX Zero40. This shaves off 8 source pixels from either side of the screen but produces a much sharper, much larger image. (Left/top is cropped, right/bottom is scaled.)

This can be toggled with `G + L2`.

By default screens have a gap between them.

This can be toggled with `G + R2`.
