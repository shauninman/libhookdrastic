- readme with installation instructions (or just add to release notes?)
	flash main-zero40-<date>.img to a small SD card, eject and insert in top TF1/INT slot
		https://github.com/dedicated-os/main-zero40/releases/latest
		
	unzip dedicated-os-<date>.zip onto the root of a FAT32 formated SD card, add roms to the games folder, eject and insert into bottom, TF2/EXT slot
 	
 
- build script needs to 
	- remove elf extension
	- remove .keep files

- main-zero40-<date>.img.zip is a release
	/proc/config.gz
	/usr/magicx/tina_config.gz

- figure out how rtc works (no games I play require this but the "mah pokemans!" crowd will flip)
	drastic appears to use the system time
		Clubhouse Games shows current time
		what happens if I change it while it's running?
			nothing
			need to reset the game to pick up new datetime
	device RTC
		read
			date
			hwclock
		write
			date -s "2026-01-31 12:30:00"
			hwclock -w

- expose setting time?
	SELECT in menu?

- can I differentiate between DC and OTG ports
	DC auto-powers on, that should enter batmon
	but otherwise we must have been manually powered on and should launch directly into the game
	yes
		cat /sys/class/android_usb/android0/state == CONNECTED or CONFIGURED when connected to the OTG port but not the DC port
	no, seems inconsistent

- change ARCHIVE to HIDE or SHOW based on item->hidden?
	- so it better matches verb-iness of other menu items
- bump some of the font tile sizes to accomodate the /, %, and & characters

- get assets into repo

- update lichee patch for new boot-resource size
	device/config/chips/a133/configs/aw3/linux/sys_partition.fex

- cleanup toolchain makefile

- figure out what can be reused with libhookppsspp on smart pro (non-s)

- create a battery thread that keeps the battery icon in sync and caches its rendering to a texture that can be blitted when red to non-menu screens too

- add htop and taskset to tina image
	pin hot thread to a specific core?
- start breaking common utils (constants, init, drawing, settings, utils) into header only includes
- cache more menu bits?
	to reduce memory churn

KNOWN ISSUES
- in_drastic_menu doesn't work anymore (so what)

-----------------------------------------------

Look up program function (eg. Drastic's quit)

	nm ./drastic | grep quit
	0000000000089c70 T lua_quit
	000000000008a110 T platform_quit
	000000000000e8d0 T quit
	000000000007a260 T select_quit

then in Cutter find sym.quit, show Xrefs, and trace its args up through the call sites
